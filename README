Amitotic simulation
============================

This README file will introduce the purpose of these simulation files.  It is primarily meant to be used for ciliate organisms with gene-size macronuclear chromosomes but the source code may be redesigned to fit other needs.

Introduction
------------

Ciliate organisms (D: Eukarya K: Chromalveolata P: Ciliophora) contain 2 nuclei in a single cell, termed the micronucleus and the macronucleus.  This nuclear division servers to seperate the informational storage from the excecution of that information.  The micronucleus is not transcriptionally active, is diploid, and divides by meiosis during sexual conjugation and metosis during asexual reproduction.  The macronucleus is transcriptionally active, but does not go through mitotic or meiotic processes.  It is also highly ploidy containing multiple copies of each macronuclear chromosome.  These chromosomes are also contain less information than was originally available in the micronucleus. This highly condensed and copied macronuclear information makes it unbeneficial to go through mitotic processes.



Model of Stochastic distribution of a amitotically dividing macronucleus
------------------------------------------------------------------------

During sexual conjugation, the macronucleus degraded and regenerated from the results of the sexually conjugating micronucleus.  Whereas during asexual division, the macronucleus duplicates its macronuclear content and divides during binary fission.
